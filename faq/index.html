                        <div class="opener" style="background: url('../media/open.svg');"></div>
                        <p class="p"  >Unlike on-premises backup, cloud-to-cloud backup does not require you to maintain physical servers or storage devices. It leverages the scalability and infrastructure of cloud platforms. This means <span class="bold">no hardware to buy or manage</span> , and backups can scale on-demand as your cloud data grows. Additionally, cloud backups are stored off-site by design (fulfilling the off-site copy need), and the provider takes care of updates and maintenance, which is ideal for businesses without extensive IT resources. In short, cloud-to-cloud backup is more hands-off and flexible, while traditional backup requires on-premise storage and upkeep.</p>

                        <p class="p">Security is a top priority in cloud backups. Reputable providers protect data with strong <span class="bold">encryption</span> both in transit and at rest – using AES-256 encryption for stored data and SSL/TLS for data transfer. Your backup data is stored in hardened, secure data centers with robust physical and network security. Our solution also uses unique encryption keys per customer and per dataset, ensuring that even if one key were compromised, it couldn’t decrypt other data. In short, your data is encrypted and safeguarded so that only authorized access (you or those you designate) can read it.</p>

                        <p class="p">FileScience stores your data in Amazon Web Services by default. If geography is a relevant, we do allow you to choose the geographic <span class="bold">region</span> of storage to meet data residency or compliance needs. For example, you might choose to keep backups in the US, EU, or Australia data centers. The data is typically replicated within that region for durability (multiple copies within a data center or across zones). By selecting a region, you ensure your backup data stays in an approved location (helpful for GDPR and other local regulations).</p>

                        <div class="opener" style="background: url('../media/open.svg');"></div>
                        <p class="p">Yes. A critical advantage of having independent backups is protection against ransomware or malicious corruption. Our Cloud-to-cloud backups are <span>immutable</span>, meaning once data is backed up, it cannot be altered or encrypted by malware on your end. If ransomware encrypts files in your primary cloud account, you can restore clean versions from the backup, effectively rolling back to a safe state. Additionally, our systems don’t execute files when copying them, so malware-infected files are stored inertly and won’t spread through the backup platform. In short, backups let you recover from ransomware by retrieving uninfected copies of your data.</p>

                        <p class="p"  >Our backups maintain <span class="bold">multiple versions.</span> Each backup run captures a snapshot of your data at that point in time without overwriting the previous one. This means if you modify or delete a file, you can still retrieve the earlier version from a prior backup. Versioning allows point-in-time recovery - you can roll back to last week's email or yesterday's document version. Essentially, backups are non-destructive: new backups add to the archive instead of replacing older backups.</p>

This item-level recovery is very useful; for instance, if one file is accidentally deleted, you can just restore that file. Of course, you also have the option to restore larger sets (like an entire mailbox or folder) if needed, but you are not forced to roll back or recover the whole system for one item.</p>

                        <p class="p"  >Built-in retention (like recycle bins or litigation hold in Office 365) is helpful, but it's not a complete backup solution. Legal holds preserve data for eDiscovery, but they have <span class="bold">limitations</span> - for example, Microsoft's litigation hold has mailbox size quotas (~100 GB) and won't retain data if a user's license is removed. It also doesn't provide easy restoration, just preservation. Relying solely on these can give a false sense of security. As one analysis put it, using holds in place of backup can be “risky” because data might still be lost when employees leave or if errors occur. A cloud-to-cloud backup keeps independent, restorable copies of data (physically separate from the primary service), which is the safest approach for general recovery. In summary, retention features and holds are not designed for point-in-time recovery or full protection - they complement but do not replace having a true backup.

                        <p class="p"  >When an employee leaves, you'll likely remove their account from the primary cloud service - but your backup can still retain that user's data. Cloud-to-cloud backup solutions will keep the departed employee's backed-up emails, files, etc., under an “inactive” or archived status. Notably, one best practice is to save costs by removing the SaaS license while <span class="bold">still retaining the backup archives</span> in case of litigation or knowledge transfer. You can also perform cross-user restore - for instance, restore the ex-employee's mailbox into a new user's mailbox if someone takes over their role. In short, employee departure doesn't mean backup deletion; you maintain the data for as long as needed.</p>

                        <h3 class="f5">How is cloud-to-cloud backup different from simply syncing or replicating data?</h3>
                        <div class="opener" style="background: url('../media/open.svg');"></div>
                        <p class="p"  ><span class="bold">Syncing</span> (or cloud storage services like OneDrive/Dropbox) is not the same as backup. Sync keeps files consistent across devices - if you delete or change a file, that change syncs everywhere (including deletions). A true backup, by contrast, maintains historical versions and separate copies. With replication alone, any corruption or deletion on the source can immediately propagate to the replica, whereas a backup can be used to recover the earlier intact data. In short, cloud sync is great for accessibility and collaboration, but it is not a trustworthy backup solution. Backup ensures you have an independent copy that isn't automatically changed when the source changes. This distinction is crucial: for protection against accidental or malicious changes, you need backup, not just sync.</p>
